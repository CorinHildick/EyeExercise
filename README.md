# Eye Exercise
A learning project done though emeritus. This project uses html, javascript, and css to animate a pair of eyes that follow the cursor.

## How to Run
Move your mouse around the screen. The pupils of the eyes will follow the cursor.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
1. Adjust parameters of eyes so that the pupils look from the center of the eye to the cursor, rather than the center of the screen to the cursor
2. Add eyelid for looking down
3. Add infrequent blinking animation
4. Add infrequent inattention animation
5. Add easter eggs when the cursor moves off the screen
6. Add easter eggs when the cursor moves quickly
